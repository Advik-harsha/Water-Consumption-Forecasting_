        <h2>Project Overview</h2>
        <p>The Water Demand Prediction project is designed to help water resource managers, urban planners, and policymakers make informed decisions about water allocation and infrastructure development. By leveraging machine learning techniques, specifically Random Forest Regression, this application provides accurate forecasts of water requirements based on key demographic, industrial, and environmental factors.</p>

    <div class="about-section">
        <h2>Methodology</h2>
        <p>Our prediction model is trained on 30 years of historical data, capturing the relationships between various factors and water demand. The model considers:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Population:</strong> The number of residents in the area</li>
            <li><strong>Industrial Activity:</strong> The number of industries operating in the region</li>
            <li><strong>Climate Conditions:</strong> Average temperature and rainfall</li>
            <li><strong>Agricultural Needs:</strong> Irrigation area</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The Random Forest algorithm was chosen for its ability to capture complex non-linear relationships and its robustness against overfitting.</p>
